User Guide
----------

In ``conf.py``, add ``sphinx_doxysummary`` to the list of extensions, and set
the config variable ``doxygen_xml`` to the list of locations of xml files:

.. code-block:: python3

   extensions = [...
       'sphinx_doxysummary',
       ...
   ]

   doxygen_xml = ['./xml']  # each directory corresponds to one Doxygen project

Then, in the input rst file, add the following directive:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

      :toctree: generated

      spam::Foo
